# Species composition of RACE-GAP bottom trawl survey data

This code pulls species names from the RACE-GAP bottom trawl catch data as downloaded from AKFIN Answers. It also helps mapping species names to Atlantis functional groups, and subset to the species that make up for most of the biomass (90%) of each functional group. This is important to attribute weights to the values of life history and biometric parameters. 

This repo contains some early scripts where the catch and CPUE data are explored. The only script that is used still is `RACE_biomass_makeup.Rmd`.
